# A/B testing project for analyzing the impact of test timer visibility on student test performance

This is the final submission of final project of CMU 19819 A/B testing, design and analysis course. This project require us to design
and implement a A/B testing experiment on topic decided by our team. The entire project took us about 1 month to complete.

## Project Description
Our project aims to measure the **effect of a visible running countdown on students’ logical reasoning performance**. To be specific, we would like to examine if a student performs better in basic aptitude tests with a countdown timer visible. In the meantime, we want to explore students’ question answering behavior patterns with or without a countdown timer. 

The result of this A/B testing experiment result might provide valuable insights for test design in the future.

For detailed experiment design and result, please see 
the [final report](https://github.com/yuweizhu1993/test_timer_impact/blob/master/ABT%20G4%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf) 
and [presentation deck](https://github.com/yuweizhu1993/test_timer_impact/blob/master/ABT%20G4%20-%20Final%20Slides.pdf).
